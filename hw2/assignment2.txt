Assignment 2. Due Friday, February 3, 6pm.


1. Stateful chatbots (60%)

In the previous homework you chatbots were stateless: there was no memory about what happened in the previous interaction turns. In this homework you will improve your chatbots with by implementing a finite state machine model of dialogue.

Study the code fsm.html and answer the following questions:
1.1 What is the shortest possible conversation, in number of dialogue turns? (10%)
1.2 What is the longest possible conversation? (10%)

1.3 Choose a task domain for your task-oriented chatbot. Design a flow chart of the interaction. State and discuss the design principles behind your interaction design. (20%)
1.4 Implement the flow chart in code, by modifying fsm.html into fsm-task.html (20%).

1.5 Design a flow-chart for a non-task oriented version of your chatbot. State and discuss the design principles behind your interaction design. (20%)
1.6 Implement the flow chart in the code, by modifying fsm.html into fsm-nontask.html. (20%)

2. Reading: Read the following paper about grownding in communication with children (40%)
http://web.stanford.edu/~clark/2010s/Clark,%20H.H.%20_How%20to%20talk%20with%20children_.2014.pdf

Write an answer to the following questions:
2.1 What are different ways people adapt their speech to different audiences?
2.2 What are different ways adults and children achieve grounding in the communication?
2.3 How could you incorporate some of the knowledge into your chatbots from the part 1 of the homework?


3. Project proposals.
3.1 Form a group of not more than 3 people. I recommend having a mixed expertise, for example: someone who is more familiar with coding, someone who is more familiar with interaction or industrial design, and someone else, like a business, PR, or marketing-oriented person.
3.2 Create project proposal in a form of 10-15 slide startup pitch deck. You can find some good examples of pitch decks online. As a minimum your pitch deck should include: 

- Team (including the team/project name)
- Problem
- Solution (concept)
- Solution (technology)
- Market (audience), estimated size.
- Business model (how are you going to make money?)
- Competition
- Competitive advantages
- Schedule

We will discuss the choice of the problem in class, I will encorage choosing something in the product/design space that is off the beaten path. It should be feasible, however, to be done within this semester.
